# WHOS THE BEST SHOOTING GUARD IN THE NBA SEASON 2020-21?

<h3> BRADLEY BEAL, WHY? </h3>

First and Foremost, a special thanks to https://www.basketball-reference.com , for disposing this data for free, and making this study possible. 

On another note,  this is just a **BASIC STUDY CASE**, which means, this has no use other than fun and studies. I'm still learning and improving on my R usage.
And this doesn't count the "eye-test", it's just statistic.


<h1> What's the motivation behind the study? </h1>

To be honest, I was scrolling trough twitter and TONS of people were saying Booker was the **BEST** Shooting Guard RIGHT NOW (06/10/2021) - James Harden wasn't being considered - Because he's playing PG, and he is definitely the best SG as common sense. -  and neither Klay Thompson was - since he is injuried - . 

<h2> Why R? </h2>

Simply because I had R classes this semester in my College, so... I decided to use it.

<h4> Se você é Brasileiro, por quê está escrevendo em inglês? </h4>

Basketball isn't one of the most popular sports on Brazil, and I'm assuming the niche for Dev + NBA is very niche, and bringing this theme in portuguese wouldn't be much of a help either.


<h1> RESULTS FOR PURE SCORING </h1>
  I tried to be **VERY** **SPECIFIC**. 
  Between ALL Shooting Guards that plays on the NBA, I was looking for those specific elite stats:
  
  * Position: Obviously, Shooting Guard.
  * eFG% : Over 50%
  * Points: Over 1400 pts.
  
  Those stats alone makes a very Specific list of players. Pure Scorers, but SMART scorers. eFG% stands for Effective Field Goal Percentage, which means, is a statistic that adjusts field goal percentage to account for the fact that three-point field goals count for three points while field goals only count for two points.

  Devin Booker is the Second Best Scorer this Season (2020-21). While, Bradley Beal, is the best Scorer (For Shooting Guards).


<h1> RESULTS FOR BASIC DEFENSE </h1>

This one is simpler, Steals and Blocks. The goal for this one is: We aren't looking for the best 2-Way Shooting Guard, we're looking for the Best Shooting guard, which means, Basic Defense + Scoring is the goal.   
 
 And for that, I looked for those stats:
 
 * Steals: Active Hands on the Defense, looking for pick-pockets and cutting passing lanes.
 * Blocks: Active Defense on opposite shooting attempts.

 Here we can see that Jaylen Brown and Zach Lavine are the best defensive players that Scores Over 1400 points and has a eFG% higher than 50%. 
 But, the difference isn't near as expressive if we compare it to their scoring potential (PTSXEFG%). 
 <h3> Which means </h3> Bradley Beal takes a step further on the list. He has good enough defense (in comparision to the others), and is the best **PURE SCORER**.
 
 
 <H1> ADVANCED Stats </H1>
 
 On this topic, I tried to be more specific. Basic VALUE for the player. Winshares and Box Plus Minus based on USAGE%.
 
 I looked for: 
 
 * Win Shares: Over 3.5
 * Usage Rate: Over 28.5%
 
 
 <h4> Some Explanations for those Advanced stats </h4>
 Win Shares: A player with negative Win Shares was so poor that he essentially took away wins that his teammates had generated (Basically explaning, it serves for the contrary, the more Winshares, the more he made his team win). Source: https://www.basketball-reference.com/about/ws.html
 
 BPM (Box Plus Minus): BPM uses a player’s box score information, position, and the team’s overall performance to estimate the player’s contribution in points above league average per 100 possessions played. Source: https://www.basketball-reference.com/about/bpm2.html
 
 Usage Rate: Usage percentage is an estimate of the percentage of team plays used by a player while he was on the floor. Source: https://www.nbastuffer.com/analytics101/usage-rate/
 
 <h3> Now that you know what BPM and Winshares stands for, you can safely assume that: </h3>
 The more Winshares, **the better**. The higher **BPM** of a player is, **the better**.

 Looking at this graph, you'll see that Booker's **WS AND BPM** is significant lower than the rest. While Beal's and Lavine is almost the same.
 It is safe to say that statiscally speaking, Bradley Beal and Zach Lavine represents a higher value than Devin Booker does.
 
 
 
<h1> FINAL CONCLUSION! </h1>

Atleast, from my POV, Bradley Beal is a better **scorer** than Devin Booker, better **defender**, has a higher **value** (WS+BPM+USAGE) to his team.

I guess, it's safe to say that Bradley Beal is the best shooting guard *RIGHT NOW*, if we're not counting James Harden and Klay Thompson. 

Also, this is from a statistical point of view, not from the eye-test.
