# Best-Shooting-Guard-2020-21-IN-R


First and Foremost, a special thanks to https://www.basketball-reference.com , for disposing those Datas for free, and making this study possible. 

On another note,  this is just a **BASIC STUDY CASE**, which means, this has no use other than fun and studies. I'm still learning and improving on my R usage.


<h1> What's the motivation behind the study? </h1>

To be honest, I was scrolling trough twitter and TONS of people were saying Booker was the **BEST** Shooting Guard RIGHT NOW (06/10/2021) - James Harden wasn't being considered - Because he's playing PG, and he is definitely the best SG as common sense. -  and neither Klay Thompson was - since he is injuried - . 

<h2> Why R? </h2>

Simply because I had R classes this semester in my College, so... I decided to use it.

<h3> Se você é Brasileiro, por quê está escrevendo em inglês? </h3>

Basketball isn't one of the most popular sports on Brazil, and I'm assuming the niche for Dev + NBA is very niche, and bringing this theme in portuguese wouldn't be much of a help either.


<h1> RESULTS FOR PURE SCORING </h1>
  I tried to be **VERY SPECIFIC**. 
  Between ALL Shooting Guards that plays on the NBA, I was looking for those specific elite stats:
  
  Position: Obviously, Shooting Guard.
  eFG% : Over 50%
  Points: Over 1400 pts.
  
  Those stats alone makes a very Specific list of players. Pure Scorers, but SMART scorers. eFG% stands for Effective Field Goal Percentage, which means, is a statistic that adjusts field goal percentage to account for the fact that three-point field goals count for three points while field goals only count for two points.

  Devin Booker is the Second Best Scorer this Season (2020-21). While, Bradley Beal, is the best Scorer (For Shooting Guards).
